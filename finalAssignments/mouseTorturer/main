% Main function
%% TODOS
%{

Environment TODO:
--------
* Set dimensions to:
    2-m-diameter circular watermaze, 
    0.1-m-diameter escape platform. 
    set swimming speed of the rat at 0.3 ms^-1

* Set walls as reflective boundaries
* Treat space as continuous
* Discretize time in 0.1s

* Make sure all values relfect the changes, including sigma

Rat movement TODO:
--------
* Model momentum: Make probability of movement 25% the decision of the actor
and 75% just repeat the previous decision.

Initialize start and end points TODO:
--------
* Compute 4 starting locations at  north, south, east, and west
edges  of  the  pool, one for each time we run the experiment per day.


Actor-Critic loop TODO:
--------
* Every set of 4 trials must contain a different location. 
* Make trials end after 120 seconds
* loop up to at least 22 trials (this is for the figures)
* Close actor-critic loop

Plotting TODO:
--------
* Basically everything
