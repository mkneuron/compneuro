function [C,dt,dw]= Critic(spikeCounts,w_critic)

% Theory:
% A value function represents the value that is assigned to a position. 
% The Critic's job is to learn the value of each position as defined by
% the reward. In this instance, the reward is when the rat finds the 
% platform and climbs on it to rest. The place cells that are active at
% that moment receive a reward proportional to their activity. 
% C is the Critic's interpretation of the value function.

w  = w_critic;
fi = spikeCounts;
C = w*fi; % calculate C-value function
